Vector boundary clipping raster data in matlab

您好，我是一个新人，现在我无法向您展示详细的通知。所以我把它们放在“作业.zip”，意思是家庭作业。
我这样做的原因只是因为当我试图完成我的作业时，我没有找到有用的信息来参考。因为淋过雨，所以想要为他人撑伞。
I am new to here, so i don't know how to add my resource to my repository, now i can't show you detailed notice.so i put them in the "作业2.zip",which means homework2.The reason why i do this just because when i tried to finish my homework, i didn't find useful message to consult. Because of the rain, so want to hold an umbrella for others.
